# ``HumanString``

HumanString is a package that lets you use integers instead of String.Index to specify ranges in strings.

## Overview

Swift adopts String.Index since Swift 4. It tends to remind you that the width of a string is not fixed. However, it can be painful to work with. HumanString provides a more human-friendly way to work with string indices using integers.
